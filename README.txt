java-ring-buffer
================

Simple Ring Buffer implementation on top of a byte array for Java.

Javadoc and Jar can be found here: http://p120ph37.github.com/java-ring-buffer

This was created as a separate project mostly just for the practice with
JUnit, NetBeans, and GitHub.  But it is a useful library in its own right too.
